### :windows_vista: Daily OS #12
## Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB 2016
Old LTSB version of Windows, its one of my favorites because of how well it runs on low-end hardware. Extended support is until 2026 and most modern Windows apps are compatible, almost no bloat too :]
- Architecture: x86, x64
- Release date: August 2016
- My rating: 8/10
- Fun grade: 5/10 Plain old windows
